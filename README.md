# Hand Gesture Recognition with Mediapipe

## Overview

This project demonstrates hand gesture recognition using the [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) library. It captures hand gesture points from a video, visualizes them in real-time, and classifies gestures based on pre-recorded templates.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Capture**: Utilizes the Mediapipe library to capture hand gesture points.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Visualizes hand gestures in real-time during video playback.
- **Template Recording**: Records and creates templates for specific gestures (e.g., "Hello" and "No Hello").
- **Gesture Recognition**: Uses a gesture recognizer to classify gestures in a new video.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: `pip install mediapipe opencv-python matplotlib dollarpy`
2. Run the `gesture_recognition.py` script to capture and recognize hand gestures.
   
   ```bash
   python gesture_recognition.py





Ensure that your camera is properly configured or update the video paths in the script.
Customize the template recording section for your specific gestures.
